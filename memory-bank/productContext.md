# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Personal finance management can be complex and time-consuming. Many users struggle with:
- Remembering to log transactions manually
- Reviewing and approving pending transactions
- Understanding budget health at a glance
- Making quick budget adjustments

This project solves these problems by enabling **AI-powered budget management** through natural language conversations.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Manual Transaction Entry**: Users can describe purchases naturally ("I spent $3.98 at REI today") instead of filling forms
2. **Transaction Approval Workflow**: AI can identify and help approve pending transactions
3. **Budget Health Monitoring**: Quick insights into overspent categories and account balances
4. **Accessibility**: Voice-first or chat-based budget management for users who prefer conversational interfaces

## How It Should Work
### User Experience Flow
1. **Setup**: User provides YNAB API token, AI helps select default budget
2. **Daily Usage**: Natural language commands like:
   - "Add a transaction to my Ally account for $3.98 I spent at REI today"
   - "Show me my unapproved transactions"
   - "Approve the transaction for $6.95 on the Apple Card"
   - "How am I doing this month?"

### AI Assistant Behavior
- **Proactive**: Suggests budget actions based on current state
- **Contextual**: Remembers user's accounts and spending patterns
- **Helpful**: Explains financial concepts and provides recommendations
- **Secure**: Never exposes sensitive financial data or API tokens

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: No need to navigate YNAB interface for common tasks
- **Speed**: Quick budget updates and insights

- **Reliability**: Consistent performance with clear error messages
- **Privacy**: Secure handling of financial data
